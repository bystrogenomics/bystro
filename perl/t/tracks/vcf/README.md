# Test data note

The file is fake at most sites over the 10 shown...the real hg38 data is mostly discordant in chr22.

Have left 15927835 as discordant example (shouldn't make it into the database)

Made 2 15927834 sites, to check what happens when sites overlap because they're cryptic multiallelics.

15927759 is acutally a real, non-discordant site w/2 alleles A,C

15927755 is a site set to T ref (to be non-discordant)

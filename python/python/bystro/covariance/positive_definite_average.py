"""
A module for calculating averages of positive definite matrices.

A positive definite matrix is a symmetric matrix with all positive eigenvalues,
making it invertible and crucial for various statistical and engineering
applications. This module implements methods to compute various means of such
matrices, ensuring mathematical accuracy and stability.

Methods Defined:
- is_positive_definite(matrix): Check symmetry and positiveness of eigenvalues.
- pd_mean_harmonic(matrices): Compute harmonic mean of positive definite matrices.
- pd_mean_karcher(matrices, tol, max_iter): Compute Karcher mean iteratively.
- pd_median_riemann(matrices, tol, max_iter): Compute median iteratively.

Basic Formulas:
- Harmonic mean: inv(sum(inv(A_i) for A_i in matrices) / n)
- Karcher mean: iterative adjustment to minimize Frobenius norm distance.
- Median (Riemannian): iterative optimization of median in the matrix space.

All matrices are assumed to be provided as numpy arrays.

Further considerations:

The numerical stability of various methods for computing averages of
positive definite matrices, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

Methods:
1. Arithmetic Mean:
   - Stability: High
   - Does not always yield a PD matrix if the matrices are not close.

2. Geometric Mean:
   - Stability: Moderate to Low
   - Iterative logarithmic and exponential operations can lead to precision
     loss in high dimensions.

3. Harmonic Mean:
   - Stability: Moderate
   - Matrix inversion can be unstable if matrices are close to singular or
     highly ill-conditioned.

4. Log-Euclidean Mean:
   - Stability: High
   - Straightforward averaging in the logarithmic domain followed by a single
     exponential mapping, suitable for high dimensions.

5. Karcher Mean (Fr√©chet Mean):
   - Stability: Moderate to Low
   - Iterative gradient descent on a manifold; sensitive to initial guess and
     convergence properties, challenging in high dimensions.
